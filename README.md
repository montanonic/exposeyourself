A text editor that records every change you make within it, at least, once it's
fully working.

~~This will eventually have a backend component to persist text histories, and
allow for sharing them. This will likely be written in Go, as I'd like to learn
more about the language, and appreciate its simplicity.~~

The future of this project will be to 
  1. rewrite it in JavaScript,
  2. make it actually work,
  3. make it look pretty,
  4. and add a back-end to support user logins (as simple as possible), allowing for cross-computer persistence, and giving much more potential for (consensual) data-analysis.

The backend will likely be written in JavaScript to help me get better at the language, as well as to better understand what Node.js has (and might not have) to offer.
